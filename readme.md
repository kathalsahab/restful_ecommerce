# Run Project

> For testing refer postman collection present in ./ecom/postman

## Docker

> Docker Install -> Refer https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

> ⚠️ The Docker and compose files are development only and should **NOT** be used in production environment as it contains `flask run`.

### Makefile

The easiest way to run the ecommerce application inside docker is to use `Makefile`

> `make` CLI utility is prerequisite. It is pre-configured in macOS.<br>Alternatively, use `docker-compose` commands described [below](#docker-compose).

```sh
make up
```

Stop the containers

```sh
make down
```

Stop and Re-run the containers

```sh
make restart
```

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can directly execute `docker-compose` commands that are written in Makefile.

> '`-f docker-compose.yml`' is optional if the compose file name exactly matches `docker-compose.yml`

Build and Run the Containers

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Stop the containers

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

## Flask locally

To run the application locally you must have `.env` file in the `ecom_flask` folder.

> ⚠️ To run flask locally, please adjust the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable in `.env` file to point to local instance of mySQL.
>
> Alternatively, Just remove the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` variable from file. This will result in generation of local SQLite DB file `db.sqlite`

With current working directory as `ecom_flask` run -

```sh
flask run
```

# Project Details

## Directory Structure

All source code is in `ecom` directory.

Code is modularized based on the Feature of the application. Each feature is grouped into its own directory following the undermentioned pattern.

```
feature_dir
├── models.py
└── v1
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── controllers.py
    └── routes.py
```

## Configurations

Development, Testing and Production configurations are separated in the `ecom/config.py` file. All the required environment variables are extracted from OS in `ecom/config.py` file and put into application config.

While development, required environment variables should be set in `.env` file which will be automatically loaded into the OS.

# Docker Commands Reference

-  Defined this app’s environment with a `Dockerfile` so it can be reproduced anywhere.
-  Define the services that make up this app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can be run together in an isolated environment.

## Docker - useful commands

### Build image

```sh
docker build -t ecom_flask .
```

### Run container in detached mode

```sh
docker run -it -d -p 5000:5000 ecom_flask
```

### Stop container

```sh
docker stop ecom_flask
```

### Docker logs : -f to follow logs

```sh
docker logs ecom_flask -f
```

### Exec : run commands inside docker container

`-i -t` : for making it interactive and tty session. This helps in exiting the container with <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>

```sh
docker exec -it ecom_flask bash
```

### Docker cleanup commands

```sh
docker images prune
docker volume prune
docker system prune
```

### Docker list all containers

```sh
docker ps -a
```

## Docker Compose - useful commands

### Start containers

```sh
docker-compose up
```

### Build the container and start docker compose in background

```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Shutdown the containers

```sh
docker-compose down
```
